# Medical-OCR
The Dr AI OCR project aims to revolutionize the healthcare landscape by combining cutting-
edge technologies in Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP),
and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of medical
data. By integrating Tesseract OCR for text extraction, SciSpaCy for biomedical entity
recognition, and ChatGPT for AI-powered analysis, this solution provides a robust platform for
processing medical documents and diagnostic data efficiently and accurately.

Medical Diagnosis & Report Analyzer - Flask App

Overview
This Flask-based web application predicts medical conditions (such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, and more) using trained machine learning models. Additionally, it provides a report analyzer that summarizes medical reports using ChatGPT.

Features
✅ Predicts multiple medical conditions using machine learning models  
✅ Supports image-based and text-based report analysis  
✅ Uses OpenAI's ChatGPT for advanced report summarization  
✅ User-friendly web interface built with Flask  
✅ Secure file upload system
